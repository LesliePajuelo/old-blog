Perfect post for where I am right now. I can build small things in python to help me do my job. Automation, geoprocessing scripts etc but when it comes time to make bigger things it&#8217;s eeeeeek!

To get past toe Cliffs of Confusion signing up for <a href="http://freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>Â (related to <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Viking Code School </a>which posted that picture) has helped bring focus. Also, next week, on the side. Because I have plenty of time for more on the side stuff. I&#8217;ll be taking a <a href="skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a> blueprint. Probably the wordpress one as I&#8217;d like to make changes to this one and also to get more small jobs to build a web development portfolio.

    Collaborate!

Part of the reason to do skillcrush is that they have a great community of beginner to intermediate people who are serious about moving forward. The Udacity and Codeacademy forums are difficult to use as many people simply post questions or answers and move on. There&#8217;s no sense of ongoing community.

What I&#8217;m hoping to find at Skillcrush is partners for projects and/or code reviews. We&#8217;ll see, if not I&#8221;ll have to look elsewhere. Collaboration is certainly my weak spot right now.
