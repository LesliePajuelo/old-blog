I&#8217;ve worked in GIS for years and have picked up some scripting. SQL, python automation, the inevitable massive Excel macro. The last year or so I&#8217;ve started to do Mapbox and leaflet projects. Nothing big, but really, nothing big because I couldn&#8217;t!

My mapboxing is limited to looking at tutorials and cutting out the parts I need without much understanding.

So, I did <a title="codeacademy" href="http://codeacademy.com" target="_blank">codeacademy</a>. Even completed a few of their tracks, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/arrayNinja14617" target="_blank">including the javascript track</a>. Tho, to be honest, it was a little too much hand-holding. So, in search of more free-range learning but with a bit of structure I came upon <a title="freecodecamp" href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a title="odinproject" href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">TheOdinProject</a>. Both are curated and structured lists of tutorials from other sites. Including Code Academy.

Here I&#8217;ll document my learning stumbles and revaluations from hacking up tutorials to writing my own apps or webservices.
