A few months ago, before the official pre-work came in I set goals for what other preparations I was going to complete. Considering that the next couple days are family days and then a roadtrip just before starting Hack Reactor, my last bit of prep is done. Here is the list of things that are covered during hack reactor that I at least did some readings on or a tutorial:

<table dir="ltr" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

Aside from that, from several other alumni blogs I&#8217;ve scrapped the following, much shorter list:

&nbsp;

<table dir="ltr" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <colgroup> <col width="418" /> </colgroup> <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>angular</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>coffeescript</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>cron</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>d3</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>express</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>git</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">

    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      <del>[node.js](http://node.js)</del>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td data-sheets-value="[null,2,">
      xss
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Obviously, the purpose was simply to get a better idea of what each topic was. Go through their intro tutorial and just have some familiarity. Also, the student blogs were far more useful as they listed technologies not grand concepts

I should note that prework did cover things like jQuery and basic HTML/CSS. From the student blogs I go the impression it was far more important to get a solid footing on those basics as to not use/waste time on it during HR. I&#8217;m still  not sure I&#8221;m completely comfortable with jQuery as there was much google during the precourse project.
