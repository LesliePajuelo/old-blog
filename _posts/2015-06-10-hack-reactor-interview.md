8am today was my HR interview and thank goodness it was first thing in the morning, I was hella anxious.

When I got the email for the technical interview it had a list of things to study and a few questions. That was exactly the types of questions asked in the interview. On the list there was 

> Eloquent Javascript (Second Edition), Chapters 1-5, especially Chapter 5

They meant ESPECIALLY chapter 5. Thanks to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> they had also pointed me to a great practice resource <a href="http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx/" target="_blank">Functional Programming</a>. Which helped build my confidence.

Not that I wasn&#8217;t nervous and not that I didn&#8217;t mess up and stumble over my words. Also, I completely got blocked on `for (key in object)`. Seriously, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll make it in just for that. Something I knew and have used and&#8230; guess it only counts if you know it on game day.
