For week 2 we did:

&nbsp;

  1. a fun project with pseudo-classical class patterns, there&#8217;s a draft post on those, to be finished
  2. The famous <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/N-queens_problem" target="_blank">n-queens</a>. Less fun but probably more useful.
  3. A game with D3, the data driven document library.

&nbsp;

  1. Learning of the different class patterns was interesting in that javascript is so flexible. While each had different performance profiles only functional was markedly worse. The difference between prototypal and pseudo classical being mostly a preference. As part of the official curriculum we did not cover <a href="http://nick.balestra.ch/2015/ES6-classes-and-prototype-based-inheritance/" target="_blank">ES6 but our great shepherd Nick Balestra wrote a timely article on it </a>.
  2. N-queens. Sigh, I did get to a solution for the basic parts of the sprint but it certainly took working outside of regular hours. Kudos for HRR that they gave us some helper functions which made the game board and toggle pieces etc. Unfortunately, my partner was not a fan of what was premade and had problems thinking within the constructs of the legacy code we were given. When we were done with the sprint he went back and implemented it without the architecture. For my part the problem which vexed us for so long was with the diagonal checkers.  As I am not at all confident that it wasn&#8217;t dumb luck that got me to a working solution me and the n-queens will be spending Sunday together.
  3. D3 is awesome. I&#8217;ve used it before in mapping tho not at all with animations. It&#8217;s a great library with good documentation and logical syntax. My partner and I finished the basic reqs on the first day and are now having fun with it.
