Tho I&#8217;ve been under the weather for the last few days I was just able to finish the first chunk of pre-work which is due at the end of the month.

Super happy though a bit cautious. What if I&#8217;ve done it all wrong?

Specifically, there&#8217;s the recreate a well known library assignment. The first part of that assignment is to do 8 of the functions. 3 of which we implemented on my interview. On the sheet we were given there was a time estimate of 7-9 hours. In a few bursts I&#8217;ve spent a little under 5hrs. Most of that time on a single function. Hopefully, I haven&#8217;t messed up the other ones. 

Anyway, onward to section 2.
