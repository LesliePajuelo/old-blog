So far so simple!

Well Skillcrush is meant for complete beginners. This class, &#8220;Ruby, Git, and the command line&#8221; I think has a pre-req of being able to make a webpage. What I assume 101,102, and 103 teach.

We went over the most used Ruby objects integers, strings, hashes, and arrays.

Also, went over standard methods and we wrote a couple of methods too. From python world methods is simply functions.

Ruby standard methods are very intuitive such as the odd? or string.replace(&#8220;new text&#8221;)
