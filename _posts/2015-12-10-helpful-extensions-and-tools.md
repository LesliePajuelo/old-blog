### Productivity tools

#### <a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank">Toggl</a>

  * It&#8217;s easy to let a few weeks pass and have no idea what you were working on. While there are tons of time tracking apps the main advantage to Toggl is that the results are stored online and it can be used from various computers. Also there are charts, tons of them. My last time-tracking program was Rescue Time since the pro version also recorded what window you were on. However, switching between my main computer and my laptop was problematic because my information was never all together.

#### <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en" target="_blank">Video Speed Controller</a>

  * A must have for watching tons of lectures or longer conference talks. It&#8217;s quite comfortable to listen at 1.5x and for most speakers 2x speed. Hours upon hours of time saved.Â Video Speed Controller allows you to adjust the speed of any HTML5 video with your chosen hotkeys. With the hotkeys it become my preferred way to zoom through content. It really becomes second nature.

  * Coggle is a brainstorming app. The reason it&#8217;s in the productivity section is that it makes it easy to not only brainstorm but also it preserves all of the related ideas. If you go down a rabbit hole it&#8217;s easy to forget what other goals can be. Being able to go back to your brainstorming is great, it&#8217;s also beautiful.

#### <a href="https://waffle.io/" target="_blank">Waffle.io</a>

  * This tool works by pulling and manipulating Github issues and organizing them like a kanban board. If you&#8217;re working in a team or even alone the format is great for keeping on track and productive. It also keeps the most important issues on the forefront of your mind as you get things done.<img class=" wp-image-257 aligncenter" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/waffle.png?resize=471%2C245" alt="waffle.io" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/waffle.png?resize=300%2C156 300w, http://i0.wp.com/www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/waffle.png?resize=768%2C399 768w, http://i0.wp.com/www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/waffle.png?resize=1024%2C532 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/waffle.png?w=1574 1574w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
