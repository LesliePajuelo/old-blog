Sometimes I get on the bandwagon of &#8220;frameworks are bulky and slow! Boooo!&#8221;

While redoing a site for a travel agent, all that was needed was a few <divs> and positioning and setting media queries so things would shrink appropriately. Easy.

Well&#8230; You see how that map is all the way at the top? And #2 is under the map not under #1? Boooooo!

Worst part is that I wasted 20 mins futzing with it before just adding bootstrap. It took 10 mins to go through this 1 page site and add the appropriate <class = &#8220;row&#8221;> and <class = &#8220;col-md-5&#8221;> <class = &#8220;embed-responsive-item&#8221;> but no futzing around afterward.

And I&#8221;m now back in the wooooo! frameworks! Also, added tabs last minute and now things are looking snazzier&#8230; err straighter I mean.
