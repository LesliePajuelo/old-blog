Finished all the prework, the recommended readings and am just giddy and nervous now.

The hardest part of the prework ended up being a deceivingly small section on recursion. Having gone through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1" target="_blank">Code Academy&#8217;s recursion</a> module gave me false confidence that I had understood it. On the to-do list of things to do is to make some sort of trainer for recursion like what <a href="http://reactivex.io/learnrx/" target="_blank">jhusain made for functional programming</a>.

Having finished the section I think I have a better grasp on it. Though only to the point that I can see how to use recursion instead of a while loop. Probably because I think of the terminating case as the conditional for a while loop. Other uses don&#8217;t seem as intuitive aside from tree traversal which seems to fit the wikipedia definition

> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science" target="_blank">Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances.</a>
