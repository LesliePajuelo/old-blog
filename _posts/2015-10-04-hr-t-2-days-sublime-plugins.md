All the rage in our slack channel are which sublime packages we&#8217;ve installed. The recommendations are:

&nbsp;

  1. <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/" target="_blank">Package control </a> &#8211;  install by following the directions on the site, they change for each OS. Makes installing the other packages trivial
  2. <a href="https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime" target="_blank">Emmet</a> &#8211; reduces typing, especially for HTML/CSS. Type in short strings and it converts&#8230; one of those that seems best to have worked with before starting HR, since there&#8217;s so much to learn. The <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a> is huuge.
  3. <a href="http://sublimecodeintel.github.io/SublimeCodeIntel/" target="_blank">SublimeCodeIntel</a> &#8211; for the autocomplete
  4. <a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git" target="_blank">Git</a> &#8211; not sure if it&#8217;ll be easier to use than just using <a href="http://guake.org/" target="_blank">Guake</a> but we&#8217;ll see.
  5. <a href="https://floobits.com/help/plugins" target="_blank">Floobits</a> &#8211; kinda required since it&#8217;s our code sharing platform

Tomorrow is my tech check to make sure my environment is set up properly, and that I know how to use it, then Monday it starts! weeeee
