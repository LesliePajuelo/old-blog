The first deadline for the first section of the pre-work is coming up in a few days and I&#8217;m a bit frazzled.

There are required sections, which I&#8217;ve completed, and extra-credit which I have not. At the moment I&#8217;m at the end of Section 2 but not quite done. It&#8217;s the twitter clone assignment and I&#8217;m wanting to do a good enough job to show it off to people, but that includes the extra-credit portion of allowing people to post. 

Section 3 is due at the end of September a week or so before class begins and it&#8217;s recursion which they have 8-10 hours estimated for implementing 2 functions. Which makes them a bit scary.
