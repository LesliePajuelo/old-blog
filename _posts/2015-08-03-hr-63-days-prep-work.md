Prework finally got here and it looks like a lot. 

Luckily, the first section is review for me but 2nd and 3rd sections look intimidating. There&#8217;s plenty of time I think. It&#8217;s just a matter of not getting overwhelmed.

I&#8217;m happy that my pre-pre work included plenty HTML/CSS as <a href="http://www.quora.com/For-Hack-Reactor-alumni-in-retrospect-if-there-was-one-subject-matter-you-could-have-prepared-yourself-better-for-prior-to-Hack-Reactor-what-would-it-be-and-how-would-you-prepare-for-it" target="_blank">this quora question</a> implies it&#8217;s important to have a good foundation. 

I&#8217;m not sure how much I can publish about the actual pre-work so I&#8217;ll err on the side of caution. It does seem like <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freecodecamp.com</a> sections 3-6 would be analogous for the first part. But it dives deeper fast.

There are 3 deadlines given a week apart all the way in September. My goal atm is to finish parts 1 and 2 by September and spend more time on part 3 and the optional stuff to be more prepared for week 1.
