Day 2 at HRR and the technical material has been all review of the precourse work. The new material has been with soft-skills and expectiations.

To begin with, they make clear that while they may be the best coding bootcamp what they really are is a _career accelerator.Â _To that end about half of the lectures or Q&As have been on interacting with HHR, each other, and ultimately our future co-workers.

The goals of HRR are:

  * Autonomy &#8211; confidence that you can find a solution
  * Technical know-how
  * Great learning skills
  * Calm in the face of frustration

Which would be awesome if that&#8217;s how I feel after my 13 weeks here. Tomorrow is the first day of new material and it&#8217;s computer sciencey and that has me a tad nervous.

&nbsp;

But at least I&#8217;ll be armed (or warned?) on how to ask good questions&#8230; it really is an all-inclusive experience.

  * Google
  * Catch the other person up and know they are on the same page
  * Be concise and precise with your language
  * Help desk or chat ask 1 question at time. If you&#8217;re going to be interrupting someone batch your questions.
  * Don&#8217;t be a help vampire

Last two notes I have on the culture side of things is that learning can be frustrating and to be comfortable with the unknown.
